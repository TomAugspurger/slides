# Scalable Machine Learning with Dask

# Python

- Great libraries for data analytics, but
- NumPy and pandas are essentially limited to a single thread
- Scikit-learn is essentially limited to a single machine

# Dask

(In 3 minutes)

???
Brief (5 minute) introduction to what dask provides before onto `dask-ml`.

---

# Dask

- Familiar API for large datasets
- Parallel, distributed computation

???
Dask provides users with containers to manipulate large datasets using
a pandas- or NumPy-like API.

Dask provides schedulers to manage parallelism.

---

# Familiar API for Large Datasets

```python
In [1]: import dask.dataframe as dd

In [2]: indiv = dd.read_parquet("data/indiv-*.parq/")

In [3]: total_by_employee = (
   ...:     indiv.groupby('employer')
   ...:         .transaction_amt.sum()
   ...:         .nlargest(10)
   ...: )

In [4]: total_by_employee
Out[4]:
Dask Series Structure:
npartitions=1
    int64
      ...
Name: transaction_amt, dtype: int64
Dask Name: series-nlargest-agg, 110 tasks
```

# Familiar API for Large Datasets

```python
*In [1]: import dask.dataframe as dd

*In [2]: indiv = dd.read_parquet("data/indiv-*.parq/")

In [3]: total_by_employee = (
   ...:     indiv.groupby('employer')
   ...:         .transaction_amt.sum()
   ...:         .nlargest(10)
   ...: )

In [4]: total_by_employee

# Dask Collections Build Task Graphs


<img src="figures/total-by-employee-simple.png" width="100%">

- Results aren't computed immediately
- dask's schedulers `compute` graphs in parallel

---

# Familiar API for Large Datasets

```python
In [5]: total_by_employee = (
   ...:    indiv.groupby('employer')
   ...:        .transaction_amt.sum()
   ...:        .nlargest(10)
   ...:)


In [6]: avg_by_occupation = (
   ...:     indiv.groupby("occupation")
   ...:         .transaction_amt.mean()
   ...:         .nlargest(10)
   ...: )
   
In [7]: results = dask.compute(total_by_employee,
  ...:                        avg_by_occupation)
```

Large Models / Large Datasets

# Fitting Large Models

1. You have an ensemble of many estimators
2. You have many hyper-parameters
  
???
This section shows `dask_ml.joblib`, how to use your `dask.distributed` cluster
to fit a regular scikit-learn model on an dataset that fits in memory. This uses
all the nodes on your cluster to do the individual tasks inside scikit-learn.

---

# Distributed Scikit-Learn: Joblib

- Each worker gets a copy of the data
- Tasks parallelized by `n_jobs`

```python
from sklearn.externals import joblib
from dask.distributed import Client

client = Client('scheduler-address')
clf = RandomForstClassifier(n_estimators=200, n_jobs=-1)

with joblib.parallel_backend("dask", scatter=[X, y]):
    clf.fit(X, y)
```

</video>


???
This video shows the distributed UI while fitting a `RandomForstClassifier` with
200 trees. Each tree is an individual task. Fitting the 200 trees is an
embarrassingly parallel job, and can be done across the cluster.

---

# Parallel Post-Fitting Tasks

Train on a small dataset normally

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.svm import SupportVectorClassifier
   ...: from dask_ml.wrappers import ParallelPostFit
   ...:
   ...: clf = ParallelPostFit(SupportVectorClassifier())
   ...:
   ...: X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100_000, chunks=10_000)
   ...:
   ...: clf.fit(X, y)
```

---

# Parallel Post-Fitting Tasks


Transform / Predict in parallel

```python
In [2]: clf.predict_proba(X)
Out[2]: dask.array<predict_proba, shape=(100000, 2),
                   dtype=float64, chunksize=(10000, 2)>

In [3]: clf.predict_proba(X).compute()
Out[3]:
array([[0.03456433, 0.96543567],
       [0.01632352, 0.98367648],
       [0.16356299, 0.83643701],
       ...,
       [0.0150388 , 0.9849612 ],
       [0.98526749, 0.01473251],
       [0.01522759, 0.98477241]])
